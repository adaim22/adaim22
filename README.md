- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adaim22 (Abdelrahman Abdeldaim) <br>
I am currently a first year Computer Science student at the University of Manchester.<br>
I've got about 2 years of coding experience under my belt, but I've learnt a lot in those last 2 years and I'm always looking forwards to learning even more whenever possible!
